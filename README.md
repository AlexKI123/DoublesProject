# Doubles project

This repository contains the code and input files needed to replicate results from the manuscript "Enrichment for rare mutational
classes during molecular adaptation" by Klug, et al (in progress). This includes the code for generating all the figures. The main sections are 

* Code
  * SimpleModel. The simple model without genetic drift
  * WFModel. The WrightFisher model
  * Other. Methods and figures related to counting up and representing access to sequence space, assigning single/double/triple state to empirical data, and estimating alpha from available sources
* Data_P53. Input file with data on the TP53 case
* Data_TEM1. Input file with data on the TEM1 case
* dataEmpirical.zip. Contains our simulation results for both empirical landscapes
* dataRandom.zip. Contains our simulation results for random landscapes
* Keynote. Contains more figures

Before attempting to use these materials, please read the relevant descriptions in Methods.
